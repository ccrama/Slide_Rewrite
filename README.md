# Slide Rewrite
Repository for the Android rewrite of Slide for Reddit.

The purpose of this rewrite is to:
* Create a new, leaner, and more extendable codebase to build future versions of Slide on top of
* Implement the latest Android development paradigms, namely Kotlin and ReactNative
* Build the UI on top of a more structured theme approach, allowing more customization and easier implementation
* Implement all latest Reddit features and the new Kotlin JRAW library

To Do:
- [ ] Implement an application backend that will handle authentication and user sessions
- [ ] Set up a custom theme library (possibly [this one?](https://github.com/afollestad/aesthetic)) before we work on views in order to make them all use the same theme backend
- [ ] Create a standard extendible Activity that will handle displaying lists of submission posts, messages, and direct comments
- [ ] Settings backend to handle all preferences

After these main things are complete, we can then focus on implementing

- [ ] Main page UI
- [ ] Submission UI
- [ ] Comment UI


I will be updating this with more information once I start fleshing out some of the above points
